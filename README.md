### Running tests

You can simply run ```rspec```, so all tests may be running. But, sometimes, in some architectures may occur some errors while trying to run this command, something about pending migrations, if it is the case, you can run the command ```rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test ```, and the migrations may take effects in the dev environment as well.

### API

This project is also an API, you can send requests to it's endpoints and receive data as json.
The documentation for endpoints are listed below:

```http://localhost:3000/api/v1/buffets```  -> list all buffets registered in application

Response example: 
```[{"name": "example buffet", "id": 1}, {"name": "another buffet", "id": 2}]```


```http://localhost:3000/api/v1/buffets?query=example```  -> changing example for any fragment word you desire, the api will return any buffet that has on it's name some correspondence to the given fragment

Response example: 
```{"name": "example buffet", "id": 1}```

```http://localhost:3000/api/v1/buffets?buffet_id=x```  -> informing an id where the 'x' are, the api will response with name, description and id for the specified buffet

Response example: 
```[{"name": "event name", "description":  "This is an example event ", "id": 1}, {"name": "another event name", "description":  "This is another example event ", "id": 2}]```

Informing an invalid buffet_id, or not informing id at all will send an error message and the error status, such as:

```{"error":"Buffet_id required for this operation"}```
```{"error":"Buffet not found for this buffet_id"}```
